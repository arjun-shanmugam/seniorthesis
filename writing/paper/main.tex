\section{Empirical Strategy: Difference-in-Difference}
    I seek to estimate the average treatment effects of plaintiff victory in eviction cases on treated properties. I use the staggered difference-in-difference estimator proposed in \cite{callaway_difference--differences_2021}, which uses two-period, two-unit difference-in-difference estimators to estimate time- and cohort-specific ATTs and then aggregates them, weighting by cohort size, to produce summaries of the ATT. Let $G_i$ be the month during which the eviction case involving property $i$ was filed, such that $G_i = g \in \{\text{May} \; 2019, \text{June} \; 2019, ..., \text{May} \; 2021\}$. Let $C_i = 1$ if the eviction case involving $i$ resulted in a victory for the defendant and $0$ otherwise. If $G_i = g$ and $C_i = 0$, then property $i$ is a treated property and a member of the cohort first treated during month $g$. If $C_i=1$, then property $i$ is a never-treated property. 

    \subsection{Unconditional Estimates of the ATT}
    The following is an unconditional estimator for $ATT(g,t)$, the average treatment affect during month $t$ for the cohort first treated during month $g$.

    \begin{align}
        \hat{ATT}^{nev}_{un}(g, t) = \frac{\sum_i(Y_{i,t} - Y_{i, g-1})\mathds{1}\{G_i=g\}}{\sum_i\mathds{1}\{G_i=g\}} - \frac{\sum_i(Y_{i,t} - Y_{i, g-1})\mathds{1}\{C_i=1\}}{\sum_i\mathds{1}\{C_i=1\}}
    \end{align}


    \subsection{Estimating the ATT in the Staggered Treatment Case}
    I will use Callaway and Sant'Anna' (2021)'s multiperiod, staggered treatment difference-in-difference estimators. The following bullets summarize the empirical strategy informally; this information will eventually be placed appropriately into the subsection headers below this brief summary.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reject conventional TWFE-DiD estimator. This estimator essentially estimates the ATT by performing a bunch of 2 unit, 2 period DiDs, then averages the calculated treatment effects. Goodman-Bacon (2021) shows that this estimator is composed in part of DiD estimates involving \emph{two units which are both treated during both periods}. This is in violation of the spirit of DiD. These incorrect DiD estimates are known as ``forbidden comparisons.''
        \item The way to properly recover the ATT is to basically perform all of the ``non-forbidden'' comparisons possible in our panel dataset. More formally:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We begin with a panel dataset of properties whose Zestimates are observed monthly. At each property $i$, an eviction case concludes during month $G_i=g$, resulting in a plaintiff victory or a defendant victory. These properties are collectively known as ``cohort $g$.'' If the eviction case at property $i$ resulted in a defendant victory, let $C_i=1$
            \item Break the units into ``cohorts'' according to the month in which their cases conclude. 
            \item We estimate $ATT(g, t)$, which is the average treatment effect on the treated for cohort $g$ at time $t$, by calculating the sample analog of:

            
            $E[Y_t - Y_{g-1}|G=g] - [Y_t - Y_{g-1}|C=1]$ 

            
            \item Intuitively, $ATT(g, t)$ comes from 2 period, 2 unit difference in difference estimate. The treatment group contains all units where we observe a plaintiff victory and the case was resolved at time $g$. The control group contains all units where we observe a defendant victory and the case was resolved at time $g$. We adjust the change in observed outcomes in the treatment group by the change in observed outcomes in the control group to get our estimate.
           
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The parallel trends and no anticipation assumptions are extended to the staggered treatment context.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Staggered Treatment Adoption Assumption.} Let $D_it=1$ if unit $i$ has been treated by period $t$ and $D_it=0$ otherwise. Then, for $t=1,...,\tau$, $D_{it}=1 \rightarrow D_{it+1} = 1$. Basically, once a unit becomes treated, it stays treated.
                
                \item \textbf{Parallel Trends Assumption Based On Never Treated Units}. For all $g=2,...,\tau, t=2,...,\tau$ with $t\geq g$, we have

                $E[Y_t(0)-Y_{g-1}(0)|G=g]$ = $E[Y_t(0)-Y_{g-1}(0)|C=1]$

                Basically, for every possible 2 unit, 2 period DiD that we can run in our panel dataset between treated units and never-treated units, the canonical parallel trends assumption holds.
                
                
                \item \textbf{Parallel Trends Assumption Based On Not Yet Treated Units}. For all $g=2,...,\tau, s, t=2,...,\tau$ with $t \geq g$ and $s \geq t$, we have

                $E[Y_t(0) - Y_{t-1}(0)|G=g] = E[Y_t(0) - Y_{t-1}(0)|D_s=1, G \neq g]$

                This assumption allows us to use \emph{not yet treated} observations as a comparison group for \emph{treated} units. This is clearly a stronger assumption than the previous one and I have to think hard about whether I can make it in my case. Note that the graph in section 5.3 does NOT make this assumption.

                

                
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Now, we have a bunch of $ATT(g, t)$s. How do we aggregate them?
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Take frequency-weighted averages across $t$ to get $ATT(g)$s, or ATTs for each cohort.
                \item Take frequency-weighted averages across $g$ to get $ATT(t)$s, or ATTs for each time period.
                \item Most convincing: calculate event time $e = t - g$. Now, $ATT(g, e_i)$ expresses the ATT on cohort $g$ at time relative to the end of the eviction case involving property $i$. Take frequency weighted averages across $g$ to get $ATT(e)s$, or ATTs for each period relative to the treatment period.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
