To force to use and test Shapely 2.0, you have to set the environment variable USE_PYGEOS=0. You can do this before starting the Python process, or in your code before importing geopandas:

If you are using PyGEOS directly (calling PyGEOS functions on geometries from GeoPandas), this will then stop working and you are encouraged to migrate from PyGEOS to Shapely 2.0 (https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration_pygeos.html).
